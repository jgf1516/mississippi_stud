# mississippi_stud
Terminal based Mississippi stud game
This is my first complete project. I had made a less-refined version of this in Java, but the purpose of this (aside from the game itself) was to practice Python, and more so to learn how to use Git/Github.
I am not super familiar with standard practices, so although this has been tested and seems to be completely functional, there may be some unusual things in the code.
For example, something that is usually capitalized may not be, or vice versa.
The main improvement that could be made here is the Deck class could have been stored in a list or dictionary, and I may one day do that, but for now, I want to finish and release this game as is.
